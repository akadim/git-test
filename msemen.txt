Ingredients
- 250g of all purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- 1 liter of water
- I don't know liter of oil
Cooking steps:
- put the salt on the flour and then put some water to mix to make it into a dough, start kneading until the dough becomes elastic and not sticky (because believe when I tell you that the dough becomes really annoying to remove from your finger when it is sticky)

when the dough is elastic try to divide into small balls, and after that let them rest (I don't know what are they gonna do)
